ToDo List
====================================

* flick up/down to browse commits

* status bar (when clones/fetches are happening)

* about page - who did this

* how to page

* sharing screen - so people can see how to clone

* delete a repo

* public / private repos

* commit key for private repos

* ipad version

* bonjour sniffing - clone from other iphones


GitHub Features
====================================

* github user/pass login

* a "search github" feature

* fork/clone a github project

* send a pull request

* add a list of remotes of people that forked you



Implementation Get-Back-Tos
====================================

* read/write blob data from disk rather than memory to handle objects > 100M

* won't handle multi-depth refs 'chacon/master', etc

* doesn't handle ofs-deltas, but the client shouldn't be sending them

* doesn't keep objects in packs
