ToDo List
====================================

* view a commit

* flick up/down to browse commits

* status bar (when clones/fetches are happening)

* about page - who did this

* how to page

* sharing screen - so people can see how to clone

* delete a repo

* public / private repos

* commit key for private repos



Implementation Get-Back-Tos
====================================

* read/write blob data from disk rather than memory to handle objects > 100M

* doesn't save/check saved delta objects

* won't handle multi-depth refs 'chacon/master', etc

* doesn't handle ofs-deltas, but the client shouldn't be sending them

* doesn't keep objects in packs
