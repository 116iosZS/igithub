ToDo List

* send HEAD with packed refs 

* read/write blob data from disk rather than memory to handle objects > 100M

* doesn't save/check saved delta objects

* won't handle multi-depth refs 'chacon/master', etc

* doesn't handle ofs-deltas, but the client shouldn't be sending them

* doesn't keep objects in packs
